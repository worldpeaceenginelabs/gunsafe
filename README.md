# Gunsafe
## A CLI password manager utility for NPM, built on [Gun DB](https://github.com/amark/gun)

Gun DB is a decentralized graph database. Passwords are encrypted with Gun's SEA security library, then stored in the database's user space, which means the records can only be read and altered by the signed in user.

Gunsafe currently stores the SEA encryption keys as environment variables in `.env`.

## Install
```js
npm i gunsafe -g
```
## Usage
